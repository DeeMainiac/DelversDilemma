# DD
 Global Game Jam 2021 and Forge Jam X entry source code. Non-violent 2d game. Made in Unity 2020.2.1f1

# Info

Valac, the great demon of dowsing, has captured you. Use your trusty dowsing rod and find lost treasures in the sand. Sell them for money and upgrade your tools, and he might just let you go if you give him enough Ducats. Don't mind the other dowsers, they're just trying to escape too.

I hope you like alliteration! Also, sound warning.

The build can be found on itch.io: https://deemainiac.itch.io/delvers-dilemma

## Controls:

WASD to move.

Hold left mouse button to detect items.

The higher the tone the closer the treasure!

Hold the spacebar down to dig up the treasure when there's a high tone.
